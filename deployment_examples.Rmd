## YARN Client

### Amazon's EMR

```{r, echo=FALSE}
div(class = "col-sm-6","This example demonstrates a complete workflow using Hadoop and Hive with Amazon Elastic Map Reduce (EMR). We access our data with a Spark cluster, understand our data using sparklyr, and then communicate our insights via a flex dashboard.")
thumbnail("EMR", "images/emr.png", "examples-emr.html")
```

### Cloudera Express

```{r, echo=FALSE}
div(class = "col-sm-6","This example demonstrates a complete workflow using Hadoop and Hive with Cloudera (CDH). In addition to the workflow, we show these useful web tools: Cloudera Manager, HUE, and the Spark UI.")
thumbnail("Cloudera Express", "images/manager-landing-page.png", "examples-cdh.html")
```

## Stand Alone 

### Amazon's EC2

```{r, echo=FALSE}
div(class = "col-sm-6","You can create a Spark cluster without Hadoop using Spark standalone mode. In this example will show you how to set up a standalone cluster in Amazon EC2.")
thumbnail("Stand-alone", "images/spark-sa-setup.png", "examples-sa.html")
```

### Working with S3 data

```{r, echo=FALSE}
div(class = "col-sm-6","Pairing Spark with S3 is becoming an increasingly popular approach. Because it separates the data from the computation, it lets us tear down or the Spark cluster when we are done with the analysis without losing the source data.

We thought it would be a good idea to run some experiments to find a recommendation that may work for those who are currently or thinking about using this approach for their analyses.")

## Performance and Tuning

### Understanding Spark Caching

```{r, echo=FALSE}
div(class = "col-sm-6","By using a reproducible example, we will review some of the main configuration settings, commands and command arguments that can be used that can help you get the best out of Spark's memory management options.")

## Introduction

As stated in the Spark's official site, [Spark Streaming]((https://spark.apache.org/streaming/)) makes it easy to build scalable fault-tolerant streaming applications. Because is part of the Spark API, it is possible to re-use query code that queries the current state of the stream, as well as joining the streaming data with historical data.  Please see [Spark's official documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.3/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html) for a deeper look into Spark Streaming. 

## Scope of the `sparklyr` interface

The `sparklyr` interface provides the following:

- Ability to run [dplyr](/dplyr), SQL, [spark_apply()](/guides/distributed-r/), and [PipelineModels](/guides/pipelines/#introduction-to-ml-pipelines) against a stream
- Read and write streams in multiple formats: CSV, text, JSON, parquet, Kafka, JDBC, and orc
- An out-of-the box graph visualization to monitor the stream
- A new `reactiveSpark()` function, that allows Shiny apps to poll the contents of the stream
 create Shiny apps that are able to read the contents of the stream

## Interacting with a stream

A good way of looking at the way how Spark streams update is as a three stage operation:

1. **Input** - Spark reads the data inside a given folder. The folder is expected to contain multiple data files, with new files being created containing the most current stream data.
1. **Processing** - Spark applies the desired operations on top of the data. These operations could be data manipulations (`dplyr`, SQL), data transformations (`sdf` operations, PipelineModel predictions), or native R manipulations (`spark_apply()`).
1. **Output** - The results of processing the input files are saved in a different folder.

In the same way all of the read and write operations in `sparklyr` for Spark Standalone, or in `sparklyr`'s local mode, the input and output folders are actual OS file system folders.  For Hadoop clusters, these will be folder locations inside the HDFS.

## Example 1 - Input/Output

The first intro example is a small script that can be used with a local master. The result should be to see the `stream_view()` app showing live the number of records processed for each iteration of test data being sent to the stream. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(future)
library(sparklyr)

sc <- spark_connect(master = "local", spark_version = "2.3.0")

if(file.exists("source")) unlink("source", TRUE)
if(file.exists("source-out")) unlink("source-out", TRUE)

stream_generate_test(iterations = 1)
read_folder <- stream_read_csv(sc, "source") 
write_output <- stream_write_csv(read_folder, "source-out")
invisible(future(stream_generate_test(interval = 0.5)))

stream_view(write_output)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
stream_stop(write_output)
spark_disconnect(sc)
```

### Code breakdown

1. Open the Spark connection
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    library(sparklyr)
    sc <- spark_connect(master = "local", spark_version = "2.3.0")
    ```

1. Optional step. This resets the input and output folders. It makes it easier to run the code multiple times in a clean manner.
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    if(file.exists("source")) unlink("source", TRUE)
    if(file.exists("source-out")) unlink("source-out", TRUE)
    ```

1. Produces a single test file inside the "source" folder. This allows the "read" function to infer CSV file definition.
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    stream_generate_test(iterations = 1)
    list.files("source")
    ```

    ```
    [1] "stream_1.csv"
    ```

1. Points the stream reader to the folder where the streaming files will be placed.  Since it is primed with a single CSV file, it will use as the expected layout of subsequent files. By default, `stream_read_csv()` creates a single integer variable data frame.
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    read_folder <- stream_read_csv(sc, "source")
    ```

1. **The output writer is what starts the streaming job**. It will start monitoring the input folder, and then write the new results in the "source-out" folder.  So as new records stream in, new files will be created in the "source-out" folder.  Since there are no operations on the incoming data at this time, the output files will have the same exact raw data as the input files.  The only difference is that the files and sub folders within "source-out" will be structured how Spark structures data folders. 
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    write_output <- stream_write_csv(read_folder, "source-out")
    list.files("source-out")
    ```
    ```
    [1] "_spark_metadata"                                     "checkpoint"
    [3] "part-00000-1f29719a-2314-40e1-b93d-a647a3d57154-c000.csv"
    ```
    
1. The test generation function will run 100 files every 0.2 seconds. To run the tests "out-of-sync" with the current R session, the `future` package is used.
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    library(future)
    invisible(future(stream_generate_test(interval = 0.2, iterations = 100)))
    ```

1. The `stream_view()` function can be used before the 50 tests are complete because of the use of the `future` package.  It will monitor the status of the job that `write_output` is pointing to and provide information on the amount of data coming into the "source" folder and going out into the "source-out" folder.
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    stream_view(write_output)
    ```

1. The monitor will continue to run even after the tests are complete.  To end the experiment, stop the Shiny app and then use the following to stop the stream and close the Spark session.
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    stream_stop(write_output)
    spark_disconnect(sc)
    ```

## Example 2 - Processing

The second example builds on the first.  It adds a processing step that manipulates the input data before saving it to the output folder.  In this case, a new binary field is added indicating if the value from `x` is over 400 or not. This time, while run the second code chunk in this example a few times during the stream tests to see the aggregated values change.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(future)
library(sparklyr)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

sc <- spark_connect(master = "local", spark_version = "2.3.0")

if(file.exists("source")) unlink("source", TRUE)
if(file.exists("source-out")) unlink("source-out", TRUE)

stream_generate_test(iterations = 1)
read_folder <- stream_read_csv(sc, "source") 

process_stream <- read_folder %>%
  mutate(x = as.double(x)) %>%
  ft_binarizer(
    input_col = "x",
    output_col = "over",
    threshold = 400
  )

write_output <- stream_write_csv(process_stream, "source-out")
invisible(future(stream_generate_test(interval = 0.2, iterations = 100)))

```

Run this code a few times during the experiment:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
spark_read_csv(sc, "stream", "source-out") %>%
  group_by(over) %>%
  tally()
```

The results would look similar to this.  Tne `n` totals will increase as the experiment progresses.

```
# Source:   lazy query [?? x 2]
# Database: spark_connection
   over     n
  <dbl> <dbl>
1     0 40215
2     1 60006
```


Clean up after the experiment
```{r, eval = FALSE}
stream_stop(write_output)
spark_disconnect(sc)
```

### Code breakdown

 
1. The processing starts with the `read_folder` variable that contains the input stream.  It coerces the integer field `x`, into a type double.  This is becuase the next function, `ft_binarizer()` does not accept integers.  The binarizer determines if `x` is over 400 or not.  This is a good illustration of how `dplyr` can help simplify the manipulation needed during the processing stage.
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    process_stream <- read_folder %>%
      mutate(x = as.double(x)) %>%
      ft_binarizer(
        input_col = "x",
        output_col = "over",
        threshold = 400
      )
    ```
    
1. The output now needs to write-out the processed data instead of the raw input data. Swap `read_folder` with `process_stream`.
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    write_output <- stream_write_csv(process_stream, "source-out")
    ```
    
1. The "source-out" folder can be treated as a if it was a single table within Spark.  Using `spark_read_csv()`, the data can be mapped, but not brought into memory (`memory = FALSE`). This allows the current results to be further analyzed using regular `dplyr` commands. 
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    spark_read_csv(sc, "stream", "source-out", memory = FALSE) %>%
      group_by(over) %>%
      tally()
    ```
